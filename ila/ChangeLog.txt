5/25/2010 Test Release 2.04
	-Still uses SPI mode
	-If channel group 3 and 4 is disabled the 8K of memory depth is available.
	-When all channel groups are selected then 4k of memory depth is available.
	-Supports inside and outside number scheme.
	-Supports Test mode.
5/25/2010 Test Release 2.03
	-SPI Mode replaces the UART communications between FPGA and PIC.
	-No support for Test mode or multiple Number Schemes.

2/10/2010 Version 2.0
	-Multiple BRAM configurations files are included. Modify sram_bram.vhd to select desired.
	-extClockIn, extClockOut, extTriggerIn, and extTriggerOut are all defined, routed to external pins and seem to work in testing.
	-The arm and trigger LED's are connected and are working.
2/9/2010 Version 1.1
	-Extended BRAM to 6Kx32 instead of 4kX32
2/8/2010 Version 1.01
	-Removed LED connections and changed the trx multiplier setting.
	-Renamed core project name so the output file would be Logic_Sniffer.
