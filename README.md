SUMP Internal Logic Analyzer for Schematic Designs
=======================================================

This is a work-in-progress design, which is intended to provide
Logic Analyzer functionality in schematic designs. Intended as a
teaching tool for Digital Logic classes. This is mostly working,
but currently untested, unoptimized, and undocumented.

Most of this code is not mine; and has not yet been brought up
to my coding style. This should be remedied in the coming months.
